            <h2>Macintosh 5.1 Renewal - (Mac Pro Mid-2012)</h2>
            <p>
                In this personal project I took a 10+ year old machine (coined the cheesegrater by some), which I saw potential in, and restored/upgraded it to modern standards. 
                The computer was only built to run operating systems from the late 2000’s. 
                However thanks to hours upon hours of passionate intricate research, problem solving, community engagement, as well as servicing… the  machine now runs 2022 software/OS’s, at more than double the speed, with 0 compromises. 
                Community efforts and research have saved old macs from becoming landfill, and mine was no exception. 
                Throughout my journey I had to become extremely comfortable with config files, desktop pc hardware, driver and component compatibility, system power restraints, low level boot sequence manipulation, patching of operating systems, overwriting device firmwares, etc. 
                This project has given me a level of understanding in regards to Macintosh Hardware/Software I would've never considered vital. 
                I grew skills in community forum scraping, hardware maintenance, machine assembly, self motivation, and problem solving.
