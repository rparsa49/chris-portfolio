                <p>An Advanced VLSI Design Course. This course describes the integrated circuit design process.
                    Main topics included CMOS processing technology, VLSI design methodologies, and MOS digital circuit analysis/history. 
                    Integrated circuits were introduced throughout the course using VLSI design tools (CADENCE). 
                    I now have a much clearer understanding of the physical implementation of all the chips and logic components utilized in other classes, and have a further appreciation for the intricate designs at play for the simplest of circuits. 
                    I have experienced typical low level VLSI design/production flow.

                <p>This class discussed standard combinational modules, arithmetic circuits, latches and flip-flops, standard sequential modules, memory, combinational and sequential PLDs and their applications, and design of system controllers. 
                    We covered a large amount of implementation in schematics, and began work in Cadence’s OrCad platform, which served as a digital system stimulus/simulation/layout planning tool in our laboratory sections. 
                    This class cemented the thought in my mind that I had a passion for the hardware design of computers. 
                    This course gave me a massive amount of confidence in the building of circuits and left me seeing computers in a different light.

                <p>This course has us currently in charge of all of the design of microcontroller-based electronic systems. 
                    We’ve had to familiarize ourselves with topics of system level architecture, microcontrollers, memory, direct memory addressing, configuration of ports, peripheral ICs, and interrupt all in AVR assembly language programming within MicroChip Studio. 
                    We must take hardware and software into account when deciding on trade-offs and simplicity in needed system functions. 
                    The hardware and software designing phases are intertwined and take separate critical skill sets. Laboratory work involves design, implementation, debugging, simulation, and verification of microcontroller systems.

                <p>This course so far has presented lessons in fundamental data structures and algorithms frequently used in engineering applications. 
                    Object oriented programming in C++ is employed heavily in a wide range of applications. 
                    Our topics so far have included: programming and applications of data structures; stacks, queues, and lists. 
                    Recursive programming has been a necessity for this course. 
                    The final project had us create a terminal based library management system, with password authentication, a central database, a borrow and return system, and a time dependent due date system.

                    Project required the creation of a C++ program to run a digital library. 
                    Users must login with valid credentials, and are able to borrow, return, renew, and search for books within the library database. 
                    Teacher logins are able to remove books from the library, and request new books to be added to the database. 
                    This project stretched the limit of what our group could implement given our tools. 
                    However by using complex data structures, verification programs, loop based flows, and object oriented programming, we implemented all required functions of the project assignment.

                <p>This course presented advanced C programming concepts. 
                    Lectures discussed the C language constructs. 
                    The course also introduces fundamental concepts in computer engineering, such as bitwise operations, text file scanning, stack-based computation, table-based finite state machine implementation, hash tables, and linked lists. 
                    Lab assignments saw us abstracting, implementing, debugging, and testing C programs which utilized the ideas from lecture in different and more difficult ways.
