                Within the upcoming year “AVID” will be finally meeting to start this project. 
                This Project works to create public awareness for the struggles of disabled veterans, namely suicide. 
                The events we will put on will provide a physical and emotional avenue for disabled/able body vets to congregate and compete together on teams as to bring awareness and help struggling vets.

            <h2>SBU Up-Stander Award Member</h2>
            <p>
                Having completed the three bystander intervention training (Green Dot, QPR and Red Watch Band+Narcan) I have become eligible for the SBU Upstander award. 
                This requires the learning of various dangerous situations and strategies to minimize community and individual harm. 
                Skills developed include dealing with interpersonal/relationship based violence, detecting suicidal red flags and the appropriate following action steps, and recognizing alcohol and opiods based overdoses and their appropriate first aid. 
                All these collectively make ‘Upstanders’ important to other’s safety wherever we go on campus. 
                Having been trained and exposed to the knowledge our duty is to keep the university community more safe and healthy now. 
                Being an upstander, aware of danger, and becoming the catalyst for good is now our civic duty as trained ‘Upstanders.'
